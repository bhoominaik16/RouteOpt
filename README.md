## 📖 Overview
Traffic congestion and unsafe public commuting are major issues for students and employees. Existing solutions like Uber are expensive, while WhatsApp groups are inefficient and unregulated.

**RouteOpt** is a specialized carpooling platform that restricts access to verified organizational emails (e.g., `@ves.ac.in`). Unlike standard apps, it uses **Polyline Route Matching** to find passengers strictly along a driver's actual path, not just at the start or end points. It creates a complete ecosystem with real-time security monitoring and eco-friendly gamification.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔒 1. Domain-Locked Security & Safety
* **Verified Access Only :** Registration is strictly gated by institutional email domains.
* **Safety Toggles :** Drivers can restrict rides to **"Same Gender Only"** or **"Same Institution Only"** for added comfort.
* **Driver Transparency :** Passengers see verified driver profiles and vehicle details before requesting.

### 🚨 2. Centralized SOS & Admin Dashboard
* **One-Tap SOS :** Users can trigger an emergency alert that instantly logs their live coordinates.
* **Security Command Center :** A dedicated **Admin Dashboard** acts as a listening authority. It uses real-time listeners to detect SOS alerts instantly.
* **Dispatch Logic :** Admins can view the alert location on Google Maps and mark incidents as "RESOLVED" after dispatching help.

### 🗺️ 3. Intelligent Route Matching (Polyline Algorithm)
* **Deviation Logic :** We don't just match endpoints. Our algorithm buffers the driver's **actual route path (OSRM)** to find passengers waiting along the way.
* **Geocoding Intelligence :** Integrated with **Photon/OpenStreetMap** to convert local landmarks (e.g., "Amar Mahal") into precise coordinates with location biasing for accuracy.

### 💰 4. Fair Pricing & UPI Payments
* **Automated Costing :** Fare is automatically calculated based on vehicle type (Car/Bike) and distance (e.g., ₹7/km).
* **Direct Payments :** Integrated **Dynamic QR Codes** allow passengers to pay drivers directly via UPI (GPay/Paytm) without platform fees.

### 🌱 5. The "Eco-Loop" Gamification
* **Live Carbon Dashboard :** Tracks total CO₂ emissions saved per user.
* **Dynamic Leaderboard :** Real-time ranking of top "Green Commuters" in the organization based on actual ride data.
* **Analytics :** Visual charts showing organization-wide sustainability impact.

### 🚖 6. Real-Time Ride Management
* **Driver Dashboard :** Interactive map view with color-coded pins for the route (Red), confirmed passengers (Green), and pending requests (Yellow).
* **Lifecycle Management :** Drivers can accept/reject requests and mark rides as "Completed" to archive them.

## 📸 Usage Guide

1.  **Sign Up :** Create an account with your organization email.
2.  **Post a Ride (Driver) :** Enter start/end points. The app calculates the route, price, and distance automatically.
3.  **Find a Ride (Passenger) :** Enter your pickup/drop location. The smart filter finds drivers passing within **5km** of your route.
4.  **Request & Approve :** Passenger sends a request; Driver approves via the Dashboard.
5.  **Ride & Pay :** Meet at the pickup point. On completion, scan the driver's QR code to pay the calculated fare.
6.  **Emergency :** In case of danger, press the SOS button to alert the Admin Dashboard immediately.
